            <p>Hi! My name is Courtney and I am a full stack software engineer. I am proficient in JavaScript, React JS, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML and CSS.

            I received my undergraduate bachelor's degree in Psychology and Sociology. When it was time to graduate I applied to a technology company  to work in support. 

            After working there for 2 years I realized that I wanted to be the one building the applications that I was supporting. I then left my job to attend Flatiron School full time to become a software engineer.

            My time at Flatiron school was the most challenging fifteen weeks of my life. It forced me to think im a completely different way, that I never had before.

            I am excited to continue my journey into the world of coding and cannot wait for what is next!
